# Covid Vaccine Statewise Analysis

This repository contains the code and report for the mini-project titled "Covid Vaccine Statewise Analysis" carried out by Omkar Shinde and Amey Wadgaonkar under the guidance of Prof. Rutuja Kulkarni at SCTR's Pune Institute of Computer Technology.

The project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the COVID-19 vaccination data in India using the dataset available on Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is covid_vaccine_statewise.csv, which can be accessed from Kaggle.
## Objectives

1. Describe the dataset.

2. Perform preprocessing on the given dataset.

3. Analyze the number of persons vaccinated for the first dose statewise.

4. Analyze the number of persons vaccinated for the second dose statewise.

5. Determine the number of males vaccinated.

6. Determine the number of females vaccinated.
## Libraries Used

 • Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

 • NumPy: For numerical computations.
 
 • Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
## Methodology

1. Data Collection: Gather the relevant data from reliable sources.

2. Data Loading: Load the data into a suitable data structure (e.g., DataFrame) using Python.

3. Data Overview: Examine the structure, dimensions, and basic statistical summaries of the dataset.

4. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure data quality.

5. Data Visualization: Create visual representations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

6. Feature Engineering: Extract or transform features to derive new meaningful variables.

7. Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical techniques to uncover insights, correlations, and associations.

8. Data Segmentation: Group and explore data based on different criteria (e.g., demographics, time periods).

9. Conclusion and Reporting: Summarize findings and present the results of the EDA process.
## Results

The detailed results of the analysis, including visualizations and statistical insights, are documented in the project report.
## Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed the COVID-19 vaccination data in India using the `covid_vaccine_statewise.csv dataset`. The analysis provided insights into the number of individuals vaccinated for the first and second doses across different states, as well as the number of males and females vaccinated. These insights can aid in understanding the progress of vaccination efforts in India and help in formulating effective strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
